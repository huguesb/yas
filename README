I. BUILD
	
	A qmake project file is provided. Compiling is just as easy as:
	$ qmake && make
	
	A default Makefile is provided in case qmake is not available.
	
	By default YAS uses readline as its input backend. If readline is not
	available it can be built with a simplified input backend. To disable
	the readline backend you can either :
		
		# comment out / remove the line "CONFIG += readline" from yas.prog
		
		# remove "-DYAS_USE_READLINE" and "-lreadline -lncurses" from the
		default Makefile
	
	A full rebuild is needed for the configuration change to take effect :
	$ make clean && qmake && make
	or, if using the default Makefile :
	$ make clean && make
	
	
II. USE
	
	$ yas
	The program then behaves like a standard shell.
	Type "exit" to quit.
	You can use "liste_ps" or "list_tasks" (same command) to get the  statuses
	of all the tasks running background.
	
	
	
III. DOCUMENTATION
	
	The documentation is provided as doxygen (see ./doc/html/index.html).
	You can regenerate it in case it has evolved or isn't present by doing :
	$ doxygen
	
	
	
IV. POSSIBLE IMPROVEMENTS
	
	# better error reporting (exec.c)
	# completion of executables in $PATH
	# management of user-defined variables
	# management of special variables ($0..$n $? $0)
	# complex redirections like >> 2>1 &>
	# implementation of && and ||
	# arithmetic expansion
	# logic, control flow & functions
