I. BUILD
	
	A qmake project file is provided. Compiling is just as easy as:
	$ qmake && make
	
	
	
II. USE
	
	$ yas
	The program then behaves like a standard shell.
	Type "exit" to quit.
	You can use "liste_ps" or "list_tasks" (same command) to get the 
	statuses of all the tasks running background.
	
	
	
III. DOCUMENTATION
	
	The documentation is provided as doxygen (see ./Doc/html/index.html).
	You can regenerate it in case it has evolved or isn't present by doing :
	$ doxygen
	
	
	
IV. POSSIBLE IMPROVEMENTS
	
	# error reporting in exec.c
	# management of user-defined variables
	# management of special variables ($0..$n $? $0)
	# complex redirections like >> 2>1 &>
	# implementation of && and ||
	# arithmetic expansion
	# logic, control flow & functions
